# JavaScript ðŸŽ²Roll

Totally legit way to decide who will clean the house!

A Part of the *pepites* (fun projects) that I do on the side as a part of continuous learning.

> Pepites is a French word for nuggets.

This dice roll is built with vanilla JS. 

## How to Use

This is the most honest, legit and free way of deciding anything. It's simple, whoever gets the higher number in the roll gets to decide.

Just Roll the dice and let the Dice Gods decide. All you have to do is pick who is Player 1 and who is Player 2.

## Applications

Having a fight about who will clean the house?

Two opposing views on your country's political situation?

Trouble selecting whose chosen destination to go to for the next trip?

Who goes grocery shopping?

Should we get a dog or a cat?

Essentially, anything that is completely and in a foolproof way, decided by chance and destiny. This is how you live life.
